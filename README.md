# Pinterest-image-scraper
A simple Python image scraper for Pinterest using beautifulsoup

# Getting Started

You will need a few things on your system to get this working:

    Python 3.10
    requests 2.28.1 (I'm sure earlier versions work too, but I have not tested)
    
Create an folder named Images
You will have to insert the link you want to scrape into the Code directly
type py scraper.py into your cmd to start the scraper

pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install urllib3
