# Pinterest-image-scraper
A simple Python image scraper for Pinterest using beautifulsoup

# Getting Started

You will need a few things on your system to get this working:

    Python 3.10
    requests 2.28.1 (I'm sure earlier versions work too, but I have not tested)
    
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install urllib3
